### Description:
Developed an application that exploits the vulnerabilities of RCS (Rich Communication Systems). The core
component was written in Python. Subsequently, I crafted a web interface with Django to streamline the script’s
utilization. 
This application processes files containing network packets, often referred to as ’capture files.’ The
purpose is to extract valuable information based on specific patterns.

### About the script:
The 'brain' of the project is the utility class RCS_EXP. This class processes the actual capture file and extracts the necessary information from the file's packets (selecting only files with the TCP transport protocol for processing).

At the end of processing the capture file, an intermediate JSON file will be generated.
This JSON file will be further processed to find patterns and to create another file with useful information. The class responsible for this is named ParseRaport.
The 'brain' function of the ParseRaport class is parse_JsonFull, which will receive a list of user-defined patterns (manually).
Pattern definition will be done in the patterns.json file.
It should be noted that currently, there is no automated process for these patterns; their definition must be done manually.
The result of the function called "parse_JsonFull" will be a JSON file, as well as a text file, containing the same data.
The text file is intended to facilitate the transposition of its information into the website.
